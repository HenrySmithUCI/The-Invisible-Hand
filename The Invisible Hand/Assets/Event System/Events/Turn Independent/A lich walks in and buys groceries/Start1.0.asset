      turn away from the\r\nmain floor for a moment to check whether you have any
      cumin behind the counter. When you turn back, there is an impeccably dressed
      man standing at the counter. He\u2019s not one of your regular customers, and
      you don\u2019t recall seeing him in the store before you turned around, but
      he\u2019s patiently waiting at the counter so you ask \u201Cif you\u2019ll give
      me just one minute, I\u2019ll be right with you sir\u201D."

      across your apron to\r\nsmooth out any wrinkles while you have a moment to breathe.
      He flashes you a perfect smile and responds \u201CI was hoping I would be able
      to make you an offer. I\u2019m a local businessman, you see, and I was hoping
      to acquire a few shipments of food. I have a some fairies in stock that I would
      be willing to offer in exchange, and I can assure you it would be quite the
      deal."

      to trade\r\nvaluable fairies for simple food shipments. The fairy poaching market
      was quite large, so it\u2019s possible he gained them through illicit means
      and now wants to hawk the off for a more legitimate product. You find yourself
      somewhat disarmed by his charisma though, and consider the offer carefully."
