      the pages to see if there\u2019s anything important happening that you need
      to know about. None of the articles seem particularly interesting, but you notice
      Phandalin, the major cotton producer for the city, mentioned in an article about
      a criminal. "

      will rise in price rather drastically. This, in turn, will hike the price of
      cloth, which could be a bit of a problem. It\u2019s a good thing you bothered
      to actually read the news today."
