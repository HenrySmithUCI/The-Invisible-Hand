    text: An enormous man walks into your store one day, covered head-to-toe in heavy,
      concealing robes. He reminds you a bit of the wizards from ancient myths, men
      who could sling magic from their bare hands at a whim with no preparation or
      ingredients necessary.

    text: "He enters silently, and you probably wouldn\u2019t have noticed him enter
      the store if not for the bell on the front door. However, after a while of hovering
      around he leaves without a word. How strange."
