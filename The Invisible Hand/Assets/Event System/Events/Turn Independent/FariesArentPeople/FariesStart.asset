    text: An enormous man walks into your store one day, covered head-to-toe in heavy,
      concealing robes. He reminds you a bit of the wizards from ancient myths, men
      who could sling magic from their bare hands at a whim with no preparation or
      ingredients necessary.

      and you\u2019re alarmed to see a near-perfect, alabaster face staring down at
      you. "
