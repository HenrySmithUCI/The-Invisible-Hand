      items below the counter. You poke your head above the counter, but no one is
      in sight, so you go back to your organizing. Not a moment later you hear what
      you can only describe as a cat being strangled to death a few feet away, startling
      you so much that you drop what you\u2019re holding and scramble away from the
      noise."

      me!\u201D in the coarsest voice you\u2019ve ever heard. You lean over the counter
      and are greeted by the probably smiling faces of a pair of goblins. They\u2019re
      covered in soot, especially around their hands, and they\u2019re dressed as
      if they came straight from a mine or a forge. Goblins are known for their masterful,
      if unreliable, metalwork, and you\u2019ve also heard that they never buy, preferring
      to craft everything themselves. That begs the question\u2026"

      attempting the best replica of a smile they can maintain. \u201CHow would you
      like to sponsor our newest business venture?\u201D The other takes over for
      the first and continues \u201Cwe\u2019ve obtained the exclusive mining rights
      to the Fartheen hills, and we\u2019re looking for investors to sponsor our mining
      operations\u201D. They both clap each other on the back, apparently congratulating
      themselves on the social interaction so far, and then turn back to stare at
      you"
